Sometimes having many options is not great. Let's say you would like to excercice, but are too lazy to pull your shit together and therefore go on finding excuses to escape the task. By removing an option not to excercise, you are left only with an option to do it. *not an option not to do something* is a liberating thought leaving you of no option, but to put your shit together and get on with it!
